"bod":"SO I got a make a disclaemer 2 begin wit. I havent acchually played Unchart 4. I d'nt owen an X-Box One so like I kan't pley it bcuz itz an ecksclusive ): I did wach Pieuwdie Pie pley it tho and I tink I know wat it's like becuas that. So to stert off I think ubisoft shold rename this gam to Uncharted 4 A Theefs Backend becaus it stinks. I just hat to wach a lets pley and I kno wat it's lik becus it shold just b a film. The grapics lok enugh like a flilm tho I gues so thaths good. But piewdiepie kept on saying tha it lookd reel and I donut agrea withh im It lookx like a video gam because it is one ant it has a HOOD on The screan sopme tims and also ther are somethimes bugs that dont look reel and it also looksd like a gam becous there ar loads of hamdholds on al thew kliffs ant you kan c the plaeces you shold klimb.<br> But yhe gam was sdill pritty col and I'd reckoment it to play. The storey was bad becauz Nathe Drak lide to hiz WiFi adn tolt her he wuz goink diving when he acktually went expliring wih his big broder Sammy Dreke.Alslo the charakters are called Drake but dey never do any Raps in the game an I think they sold because them the gane would b a accruate potreyal of Drake who iz a rapper. The bad guys in te storie are coler then thh gud boys becuz they hvae lots of cool gunz ant kan kill the good guys if u get shot 2 much<br> Anywey that's mi unkarted Fore review I hop youe likd it."}
