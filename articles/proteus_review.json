"bod":"SO a fuw deys ago I fond this Protues gam 4 cheep on teh Humble stoar. Wat isit? i thing it wuz supprosed 2 b a minecraft cloan but dey gav up bfore dey did the crafting nd minining bits. All I done was wlok rond dis weerd iland and go to a top of a mountan an den I foun a house mad of would. Then I foun a gravey yard nd theer wuz a frog. Then it waz nite time and there wer no zombeez or no skelotins or no creppers. I tride 2 find cole 4 a toarch but acksidentaly wloked in a ston cirkle. Then tyme movd reely fast like a car.<br>Then everthin went wite amd I colden't cee proper. Then it was like sumer or somethin. I knew thiss because there was more grean stuff. There were some chiknens and stuff but I went up the monetan again an I repeeted mi stepps nd then It were autumn. I tink thiss game cold be bad becas it's rerepeatitive adn IT,s like all walkink and der arn any guns or soards to kill ppl wit. But I cept playing but it was wintor and I went up a moentain agen an then I startid floteing abov the cowds an then I saw down at a tree an I was lieke woow luk there is zigzag lins in thes sky. Den the gam closeded it's eyes an I coldn't keep playn.<br> I achually felt lik this gaem was reely relacksing aftr words. I don'k no whether I likd it r not. I meen de gaemply is more like lameplay, az it'z obiosly not finnish ang it repeets itzself, but It was als reely chilll and I injoyed jus wlokking abowte. Also dhe art luks really bad lik an oled gam but it also i like also real pretty an it feelz lik the seeson it'z supozed 2 be. I tink i'f you lik woking but done wanna do it oudsite upyu culd buy this game. Also it waz really tripey whn I  reeplayed it because it waz all weard colors lik in the pichture up abouv."}
