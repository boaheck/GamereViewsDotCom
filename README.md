#Gamere Views Dot Com

This little website was mostly an experiment to see if I could learn a bit more html javascript and css. It is hosted at [gamereviewsdotcom.xyz](http://gamereviewsdotcom.xyz)

All the reviews here are written by the fictional character Gamere Views. Gamere has terrible spelling, grammar and even at times a terrible understanding of the world. Despite all this I like to think that Gameres game reviews show some insight and may explore interesting viewpoints on games while also creating some humerous reading experiences.

This website probably isn't the flashiest or very well made but I learned a lot and it's designed to be hosted on github pages.

###Adding new reviews:

To add a new review copy the template review .json file and rename it fill out the fields and add the articles path to the review index .json file.

Please be sure to always stick to the score/10% stars game rating format and make sure you stay in character as Gamere.
