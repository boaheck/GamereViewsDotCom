			<p class='articlebody'>SO u know how games are good. I liek to play mincerft. I think that Minercraft is the best games and some people tell me that gams arnt art but minerfart is. I love how creppers are funny wghen they atk u becus they explode and broke my door and then the zombies caem into my hous and tried to atk me. But I got a diamon sord so I got to kill them and then lef throu my trapdoore int the roof at the top of my lader. I think this makes the gaem to be really art not like stupied old games that stoled minedraft's's retro pixeleated art style. Like marion brothers is totally obviousl a rip of off micennfrat adn Noch just don't sue Nimtendor becaus he alreadt has 20 milline dollers frome Mick-Soft</p>
